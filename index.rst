Tutorials

pyaerocom tutorials and examples. All content displayed here is based on the
official pyaerocom tutorials which are not part of the 
`pyaerocom <https://github.com/metno/pyaerocom>`__ GitHub
repository but are available through the
`pyaerocom-tutorials repo <https://github.com/metno/pyaerocom-tutorials>`__.

All tutorials are jupyter notebooks.

.. note::

  The tutorials are currently undergoing revision, as the initial set of
  tutorial notebooks cannot be interactively executed from the outside world,
  since they relied on access to internal data servers of the Norwegian
  Meteorological Institute.

  These *old* tutorials can be found below in Section "Outdated tutorials".
  They are still mostly valid and provide a comprehensive introduction into
  pyaerocom and its main features.

  All other tutorials, that are shown in the following rely on publicly
  available example data, and can thus, be run interactively.
