Tutorials
---------

pyaerocom tutorials and examples. All content displayed here is based on the
official pyaerocom tutorials which are not part of the 
`pyaerocom <https://github.com/metno/pyaerocom>`__ GitHub
repository but are available through the
`pyaerocom-tutorials repo <https://github.com/metno/pyaerocom-tutorials>`__.

All tutorials are jupyter notebooks.

.. note::

  The tutorials are currently undergoing revision, as the initial set of
  tutorial notebooks cannot be interactively executed from the outside world,
  since they relied on access to internal data servers of the Norwegian
  Meteorological Institute.
