    "It is assumed that you have done evaluations before, so we are not going to go through the configuration in detail, and instead only discuss the parts that are important for trends. We will start with defining a typical configuration setup. We will then look at the new options that are needed for trend calculations, both what they are, and some details about how they work under the hood. Before running the evaluation we will discuss the two different types of trends that are calculated. We will also discuss some of the errors you will encounter while calculating trends."

    "When calculating trends over more than one station, such as the trend for a country or Europe, there are two ways of doing this.\n",

    "The first way is to calculate the average time series over a region of multiple stations, then calculate the trend. This is the old way of doing things, that has been in pyaerocom since the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way is to calculate the trends for all the stations in the region, and then take the average of the slope and intersect of the trend, which then defines the regional trend. This is the new way of doing trend calculation, and is done when `avg_over_trends` is enabled. Notice that the first way of doing it is also done when this is enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes on the second way: both the mean and median of the station trends are calculated, meaning you can choose which statistic to use. One downside of taking the mean/median of the trends is that we also need to find a way of calculating a new p-value of the new regional trend. Instead of taking the mean/median of the station trends, we have instead used the [harmoic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean) to find the regional p-values."
