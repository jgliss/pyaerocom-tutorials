    "# Adding Custom Variables with EMEP\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will go through how to add custom variables to our PyAeroVal evaluation, as well as how to read these from EMEP. We will add two new variables: `elementalcarbon` and `organiccarbon`. These variables are just meant as illustrative examples, and variables for elemental and organic carbon do already exist in Pyaerocom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding the variables will be done in three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Register the new variables in Pyaerocom\n",
    "2. Tell Pyaercom how to read `organiccarbon` from EMEP \n",
    "3. Combine two existing variables to make `elementalcarbon`\n",

    "Before continuing, please note:\n",
    "1. You need to have access to PPI/Lustre to do this tutorial, due to it using EMEP files found there.\n",

Normally PyAerocom gets this mapping from [this file](https://github.com/metno/pyaerocom/blob/main-dev/pyaerocom/io/mscw_ctm/emep_variables.toml), but since we just introduced a new variables, we need to define this mapping our self.

    "Note that this way of adding custom variables should only be used for testing, and not in production. Meaning that when you have found all the variables you want to add to AeroTools (Pyaerocom and/or the EMEP reader), you should make an issue on [the PyAerocom github](https://github.com/metno/pyaerocom) or ask one of the developers to add it. There are couple of reasons why\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's it not as easy to reproduce experiments where you have added custom variables, since your additions are not documented on the webpage or in the PyAerocom code.\n",
    "2. You might get errors/memory errors which are difficult to handle, especially with the EMEP reader\n",
    "3. Other parts having to do with the variables are hardcoded in PyAerocom/PyAeroval. Examples are axis scaling, display names, etc."
